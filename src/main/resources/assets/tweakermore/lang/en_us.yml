        Sync entity & block entity datas from the server using vanilla's tag query protocol
        Sync when following actions happen:
        - Tweakeroo inventory preview
        - Litematica schematic saving
        - MiniHUD bee hive bee amount display
        - Litematica block info overlay
        Requires player having OP permission (permission level 2) for it to work

        Skip the session finalization operation of xaero's worldmap when quit a world
        So no lag when quitting server or single player
        Might have some side effects though
