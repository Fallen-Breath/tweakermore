        Always set entity's position / angles directly, when receives position / angles update packets of creatures / vehicles
        This may resolve the issue when using carpet mod's /tick [freeze|step] command, 
        that it may take up to 60gt for the entity's position / angles to be correctly displayed on the client side.
